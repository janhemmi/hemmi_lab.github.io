## About me
I was born and brought up in Switzerland where I studied biology at the University of ZÃ¼rich with a focus on Ethology (animal behaviour). At that time I was particularly interested in cognitive and social processes in primates and horses. In 1994 I came to Australia to do my PhD in the Developmental Neurobiology group at the ANU. My project explored the relationship between the structure and function of the tammar wallaby's visual system. The unusual photoreceptor topography I observed in these animals sparked my interest in visual ecology. After the completion of my PhD I joined the Visual Sciences group (ANU) where I began work on the ecology of visual information processing in fiddler crabs. I joined UWA in 2012 to work on the visual control of behaviour in fiddler crabs. The relationship between sensory processing and animal behaviour is the main focus of my research group. Much of our work is highly comparative and involves a range of different animals. We work on ants and crabs to crocodiles, lizards, fish, sharks and dunnarts.
