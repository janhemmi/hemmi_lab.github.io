Observing deep sea animals is anincredible challenge. We are reconstructing the visual capabilities of deep sea crustaceans in order to be able to predict their visual capabilities. Due to the tight relationship between visual information and behaviour, this will help us predict what is important to these animals and what drives the evolution of their eyes.
